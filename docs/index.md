## About the workshop

3D printing has become an area of intense interest in a variety of contexts in research and practice ranging from industry through education, humanitarian to innovation. At the same time, technologies, materials, usages and appropriation are in constant flux. 3D printing is, however just one of the many facets of digital fabrication, the digitalization of more and more sectors and increasingly community-based innovation and open/commons-oriented engineering practices.

This workshop at [MuC 2017 conference](http://muc2017.mensch-und-computer.de/) is intended to illustrate cases of Fab Labs, Makerspaces, Urban Labs and similar hubs at or in cooperation with academic institutions. Its goal is to provide a forum for discussing how such communities and spaces influence and are influenced by teaching, learning, research, outreach and dissemination as well as on challenges and perspectives in establishing, running and integrating such communities with other aspects of academic work. Interested in [participating](/participate)?
