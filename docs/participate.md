This workshop is intended to illustrate cases of Fab Labs, Makerspaces, Urban Labs and similar hubs at or in cooperation with academic institutions. Its goal is to provide a forum for discussing how such communities and spaces influence and are influenced by teaching, learning, research, outreach and dissemination as well as on challenges and perspectives in establishing, running and integrating such communities with other aspects of academic work. 


## Contribution formats

We invite contributors from academia, practice, activism and any other communities interested in workshop goals. There are three formats for contribution:

* **Position Papers** outlining positions, stances and perspectives on community innovation and (digital) fabrication in and with academia. 
* **Case studies** describing interesting, novel, provocative or otherwise relevant cases of community innovation and (digital) fabrication and academia.
